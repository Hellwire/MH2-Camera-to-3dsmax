this 3dsmax script lets you import a VECPAIR camera. lets you move the camera and export the values to clipboard again. 
imported string should look like this for example:
    VECPAIR 0.9625    -0.351533 1.5745 1.69162    -0.159181 1.2347 1.62118    0.5 8.95559

The camera in 3dsmax appears to be flipped. but if you take that into account you can edit the camera more easily with this.
maybe this can be fixed in the future
